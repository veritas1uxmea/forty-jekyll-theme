<h2 id="content">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in South Korea, spent most of my time there in Suwon and Seoul. <br />
 My naive self set my foot in US - straight in Manhattan (yeap, no easing in whatsoever)- by starting my Master's program in Teachers College, Columbia University. Survival was not easy, but I got to make it to PhD program in the Psychology department at Columbia University. <br />
Life is funny, my advisors made a move to the University of Texas at Austin during my thrid year of PhD, and I jumped on that train without knowing what was waiting for me in Austin, Texas.<br />
  <br />
And here I am, I enjoy every single second of my life in Austin.<br />
 </p>
I like cleaning --- up messy data, <br />
I like drawing --- with my cleaned-up data in R and Python <br />
I like digging --- the truth buried in the data <br />
 <br />
I like leaving my footprints --- in National and State parks wherever I can reach <br />
I like sleeping --- under the roof of countless stars <br />
I like flexing my muscles --- within the four corners of my yoga mats <br />
 <br />
And my journey will continue. <p/>
