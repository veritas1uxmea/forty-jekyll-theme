    <p>I ruminated on what I should do for my 30th birthday probably for a month, then finally decided to take a trip to the Big Bend - and that's how I ended up encountering this graph describing the elevation change along the trails in the Big Bend <br /> </p>
    <span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/bigbend-3.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
	<p>Clearly, the Emory Peak is the highest point in the park, and the hike up to the peak is about 4.5 miles. 
    On the other hand, the Window trail was interesting, it is the first hiking trail I've been to that you actually descend first then hike up back. <br />
