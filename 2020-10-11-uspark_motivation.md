    <p>I ruminated on what I should do for my 30th birthday probably for a month, then finally decided to take a trip to the Big Bend - and that's how I ended up encountering this graph describing the elevation change along the trails in the Big Bend <br /> </p>
    <span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/bigbend-3.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
	<p>Clearly, the Emory Peak is the highest point in the park, and the hike up to the peak is about 4.5 miles. 
    On the other hand, the Window trail was interesting, it is the first hiking trail I've been to that you actually descend first then hike up back. <br />
      <br />
    This graph is well-made, conveying information on multiple trails at at once straightforward, from hikers' perspective. This was my motivation - I would like to have fun making and sharing more graphs like this. Therefore I built this website/blog. Thankfully, free open data on US National park is already available! </p>

    I'll come back with some fun plots soon, I am excited to get on this project.
