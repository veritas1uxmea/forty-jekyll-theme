    <p> In the midst of the pandemic, I had to get out of my usual state of mind to celebrate - throw a party and get drunk. As many states near Texas required any traveling Texas residents to quarantine 2 weeks when they arrive at their states, I've decided to get to know more about Texas. And naturally, it came to my mind that I wanted to conquer the highest point in Texas, before I go to other states and climb mountains. <br />
    Where I live, Austin, is quite flat and I did not expect Texas to have quite high elevation until I looked up the 'highest point in Texas'. </p>
